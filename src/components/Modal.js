          <h2>Why AntrAI?</h2>
          <p>AntrAI was born out of a simple yet profound mission: <strong>to create technology that doesnâ€™t just process your words, it understands your world.</strong></p>
          <p>Unlike traditional AI tools that prioritize productivity, AntrAI listens, relates, and reflects the emotional depth of human experience.</p>
          <p>We believe in empathy-first design, not to replace human connection, but to strengthen it. Because if not now, when?</p>
