    description: "On a rooftop at dusk, Emi’s hair whips in the wind as scattered papers chase across the concrete. Her frozen laptop screen glares back, her grant has been rejected, and no one believes in her theory. City lights blink below, but she chooses to keep typing. She faces the fear that her life’s work might be meaningless yet refuses to let go.",

    description: "In the last glow of afternoon, Ren sits at the back of an empty classroom, a red C+ staring up from his notebook. His phone buzzes with group chats he won’t open, and his bag sags at his feet with overdue books. His dilemma is living in the shadow between failure and excellence, unseen by everyone. He closes his eyes and exhales, unseen.",
